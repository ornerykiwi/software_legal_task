# Legal and Ethical Standards Task

## Questions to consider for each scenario

         1. Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?


         2. What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?


         3. What could the company do to address these issues?

### Scenario 1 - BankingCorp
1. Not breaking any laws if they are transparent about the fact that they are sharing data and allowing third party partners to access it. It does not seem that way however. They must also know if the payday loan company comply with GDPR and it does not explicitly say that. 
2. Finacially vulnerable people are being subject to recieving marketing emails from a payday loan company. Seeing as though they have bad press, it does not seem like they can be trusted. 
3. Go with a trusted payday loan company, be more clear in their email informing customers about the changes. For example "We have made some big changes to our customer Data Privacy with third party companies, click here to see more." Customer transparency and doing a more thorough background check on the third party company would be the best things to do.

### Scenario 2 - Treasure Hunters
1. Not breaking any laws explicitly but may have some ethical concerns. Payment privacy and customer transparency would need to be implemented. 
2. People with addictive personalities could be exploited because they have to spend money to unlock hints in order to progress further. However, it does not require you to spend money to actually play the game. It would depend on the game not being too difficult to the point where you have to rely on hints, meaning users are better off spending money. 
3. I think this is a decent approach to solving their high demand issues. Maybe, on their website/social media they could explain that changes were made to keep up with demand of the game. Also, that any profit would be re-invested into the company to make the game better! Also, to be transparent about prices and the fact that it is REAL money that must be spent. Refund policy for accidental purchases too.

### Scenario 3 - friends.com
1. The main legal issue would be the location data being shared. Users should be informed about how their data will be used and must provide explicit consent for the sharing of their location data. Should be able to opt-in or out.
2. If you can't afford it then you make less friends? Ethically people could use it to take advantage of lonely people in an area. Also the free tier membership should not be made 'worse' when adding the premium tier.
3. friends.com would benefit from adding safety features like reporting, tracking locations and having a check in. Maybe a "are meeting up" feature that would check in and require you to give them an answer saying everything is okay. An opt-in feature for the location data and make it explicit about the way they will handle that data. Maybe a quiz about how the app works at the start of making an account would be the best way. Lastly, avoid making the free tier so unsuable that it would frustrate users or force them to buy a premium subscription.
